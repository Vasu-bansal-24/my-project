JAVASCRIPT CLASS HIERARCHY - INHERITANCE & POLYMORPHISM

WHAT THIS DOES:
A JavaScript demonstration of object-oriented programming using ES6 classes. Shows inheritance with a base Person class and two subclasses: Student and Teacher.

JAVASCRIPT CLASSES:

class Person {
    constructor(name, age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
    }

    displayInfo() {
        return `Name: ${this.name}, Age: ${this.age}`;
    }

    introduce() {
        return `Hello, I'm ${this.name}`;
    }
}

class Student extends Person {
    constructor(name, age, grade, course) {
        super(name, age);
        this.grade = grade;
        this.course = course;
    }

    displayInfo() {
        return `${super.displayInfo()}, Grade: ${this.grade}, Course: ${this.course}`;
    }

    study() {
        return `${this.name} is studying ${this.course}`;
    }
}

class Teacher extends Person {
    constructor(name, age, subject, department) {
        super(name, age);
        this.subject = subject;
        this.department = department;
    }

    displayInfo() {
        return `${super.displayInfo()}, Subject: ${this.subject}`;
    }

    teach() {
        return `${this.name} is teaching ${this.subject}`;
    }
}

Explanation:
class → Defines a new class in JavaScript
constructor() → Special method that runs when creating new objects
extends → Creates inheritance relationship between classes
super() → Calls the parent class constructor or methods
this → Refers to the current object instance

HTML INTERFACE:
<button onclick="showPersonInfo()">Show Person</button>
<button onclick="showStudentInfo()">Show Student</button>
<div id="output"></div>

Explanation:
onclick → Runs JavaScript function when button is clicked
getElementById() → Finds HTML element by its ID
innerHTML → Changes the content inside an HTML element

IMPORTANT CONCEPTS:
- Inheritance → Child classes get properties and methods from parent
- Constructor → Special method for creating object instances
- Method Overriding → Child classes can change parent methods
- Super keyword → Access parent class methods and constructor

WHAT I LEARNED:
1. How to create classes in JavaScript using ES6 syntax
2. How to use inheritance with extends keyword
3. How to override methods in child classes
4. How to use super() to call parent class methods
5. How to connect JavaScript classes with HTML interface
